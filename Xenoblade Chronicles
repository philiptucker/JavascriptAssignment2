        <p>Xenoblade Chronicles is a series of action role-playing games developed by <i>Monolith Soft</i> and published by <i>Nintendo</i>. It is a part of the Xeno metaseries created 
            by <i>Tetsuya Takahashi</i>, but was formed after Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith Soft in 2007. The series began with the original Xenoblade Chronicles game, published for 
            the <i>Nintendo Wii</i> in 2010; it was a critical and commercial success, and spawned sequels.<br/><br/>The series has been both critically and commercially successful 
            selling 6.8 million copies worldwide. Xenoblade Chronicles was well-received for its world design, music, stories, and themes. The series has been represented in other gaming 
            franchises, including the <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> and <i>Project X Zone</i> series. </p>

        <p>Tetsuya Takahashi formed the original concept and served as the game's executive director. Takahashi had previously worked in the 1990s on 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenogears"><i>Xenogears</i></a>, then on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenosaga"><i>Xenosaga</i></a> trilogy after founding 
            Monolith Soft in 1999. Xenosaga was intended to be a six-part series, but low commercial performances forced the planned Xenosaga series to be halved. After these events, the 
            entire development team was in a state of low morale. The initial concept for Xenoblade Chronicles, of people living on the bodies of gigantic gods, came to Takahashi in June 2006. 
            Struck by his idea, he immediately committed it to paper and showed the draft to other senior staff, who were favorably impressed. One of them, an executive called Yasuyuki Honne, 
            thought it would make a good 3D model and bought materials to create it. Construction began in July: during this period, younger staff acted as models so that Takahashi could 
            establish which parts of the gods' bodies could be used as habitable and navigable environments in various poses.</p>
        <p>After the model's construction, Takahashi decided to combine the model's concept with an unrelated story idea, which became the basis for a new game after positive feedback from 
            staff. Takahashi later said that one of the main reasons for developing the game was to bolster team morale after the commercial failure of the Xenosaga games. The team first 
            showed their proposal to Nintendo prior to the final development stages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster:_Day_of_Crisis"><i>Disaster: Day of Crisis</i></a>.</p>

            <p>Xenoblade Chronicles takes place on the frozen bodies of two warring titans, the Bionis and the Mechonis. The people of Bionis, including the human-like Homs, are in a 
                perpetual war with the Mechon machine race of Mechonis. Key to the Homs' efforts in fighting against the Mechon army is the Monado, a sword that is said to have been
                 wielded by the Bionis. During an attack on his colony, the main protagonist Shulk discovers his ability to wield the Monado and sets out on a quest for revenge with his 
                 best friend, Reyn, with others joining in as the game progresses. </p>
            <p>Xenoblade Chronicles plays as an action role-playing video game (RPG), where the player controls one character out of a party of three. The game employs an open world design, 
                with players able to freely navigate seamlessly interconnected environments. A day-and-night time cycle exists in the game, with the time of day often affecting in-game events,
                 quests, enemy strengths, and item availability: for instance, stronger enemy types appear at night.</p>

        
            <h3>Xenoblade Chronicles 3D</h3>

            <p>A port for the New Nintendo 3DS, titled Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, was released worldwide in April 2015. It features StreetPass functionality, as well as compatibility with 
                the Shulk amiibo. </p>

            <h3><b>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition</b><br/></h3>

            <p>An expanded remaster of the original game, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition, was announced in September 2019 during a Nintendo Direct presentation. In addition to 
                enhanced visuals, remastered music, an updated user interface, and other quality-of-life improvements, Definitive Edition also includes a new epilogue scenario titled Future 
                Connected, which centers on the character Melia and is set one year after the main game's events.</p>

            <h2><b>Xenoblade Chronicles X</b><br/></h2>
            <img src="Xenoblade_Chronicles_X_-_Boxart.jpg"alt="Xenoblade Chronicles X Boxart" height="100" width="auto" style="float:top">
            <p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is unconnected to any previous game in the Xeno series, although there are thematic and aesthetic references. After Earth is caught in the crossfire 
                of an alien war, humanity escapes on spaceships — only a few ships make it off the planet, one of them being the White Whale, containing the city New Los Angeles (NLA). 
                The game takes place on Mira, an uncharted world far away from Earth where the White Whale crash-lands: NLA becomes the center of human activity and commerce. Mira is 
                divided into five continents — Primordia, which has the most Earth-like environment; Noctilum, covered by forests and filled with bioluminescent lifeforms; Oblivia, 
                dominated by desert and ancient ruins; Sylvalum, a pale landscape clouded in mist and dominated by large plants and rock formations; and Cauldros, a volcanic land controlled 
                by the Ganglion</p>
            <p>The main character is a player-created avatar whose body type, appearance, and voice can be chosen from a variety of options. The avatar becomes a member of BLADE 
                (Builders of the Legacy After the Destruction of Earth). Joining the avatar on their missions is Elma, the leader of BLADE and Colonel of NLA's Skell forces; Lin Lee Koo, 
                BLADE's engineer and a girl genius who created and maintains NLA's Skell mechs; and Lao Huang, a former US Army officer with a cool exterior.</p>
            <p>Xenoblade Chronicles X opens as humanity, warned of its impending destruction in the crossfire between two warring alien races, constructs interstellar arks to escape Earth. 
                However, only a few arks escape the destruction, including the White Whale. Two years after launching, the White Whale is attacked and transported to Mira. During the 
                crash-landing, the Lifehold—a device containing the majority of the human colonists—is separated from the White Whale, with lifepods containing colonists being scattered 
                across Mira. The avatar is awoken from a lifepod by Elma and brought back to New Los Angeles. While suffering from amnesia, the avatar joins BLADE, working with Elma and 
                Lin to recover more lifepods and search for the Lifehold. During their missions across Mira, BLADE encounters multiple alien races, learning that those attacking them are 
                part of the Ganglion coalition, an alliance of races led by the Ganglion race, who are intent on destroying humanity.</p>

            <h2><b>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</b><br/></h2>
            <img src="XenobladeChronicles2.jpg"alt="Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Boxart" height="100" width="auto" style="float:top">
            <p>The game is set in the fictional land of Alrest, a sea topped with clouds, called the "Cloud Sea", inhabited by massive creatures known as Titans on which humanity lives. 
                Legends claim humanity once lived atop the "World Tree", a massive tree in the center of Alrest in a paradise called Elysium with their creator, the Architect, but they
                 were exiled for unknown reasons and given the Titans to live on. Blades are powerful beings summoned from "Core Crystals" who channel power into their weapons through a 
                 force called ether. Their masters are called Drivers; when a Driver dies, their Blade reverts to a Core Crystal and loses their memory. After some time, another Driver 
                 can awaken them so long as the crystal is intact. Due to the close spiritual bond between Driver and Blade, the personality of the former influences that of the latter. 
                 Two nations, Mor Ardain and Uraya are on the brink of war throughout the story. </p>
            <p>Different from prior titles, characters in the party also control additional beings known as Blades. Each character can only have three Blades active at a time, which
                 determines the character's class, between offensive attacker, healer or defensive tanks. The game's Blades and skills are based on eight elements: fire, water, wind,
                  ice, electric, earth, light and dark. There are a total of 40 distinctly unique "rare" Blades to collect throughout the base game with an additional 11 being obtainable 
                  either through downloadable content or New Game Plus in later patches. Most of the game's Blades are not a part of the main story, and can be assigned to any Driver; 
                  among those is KOS-MOS from the Xeno sub-series <i>Xenosaga</i>.</p>
            
            <h3><b>Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna - The Golden Country</b><br/></h3>

            <p>Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country is DLC (Downloadable Content) for Xenoblade Chronicles 2 that features a brand-new story and environments, 
                taking place 500 years before the events of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. It explores the pasts of several main characters from the base game, such as Jin, Mythra, Malos, and 
                Praetor Amalthus, and introduces characters such as Lora and Addam as playable party members.</p>

            <h2><b>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</b><br/></h2>
            <img src="Xenoblade3.png"alt="Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Boxart" height="100" width="auto" style="float:top">
            <p>Set after the events of Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes place in the world of Aionios, where the mechanically proficient 
                nation of Keves and the ether-oriented nation of Agnus are at constant war with one another. The world is divided into colonies, each with their own giant metal mech 
                called a Ferronis, which trap the life force of fallen enemy soldiers in a Flame Clock. The wars are fought by engineered soldiers with artificially limited lifespans 
                of ten years, as they fight to fill their colony's Flame Clock in hopes of receiving a Homecoming ceremony at the end of their term. Among both forces are "off-seers", 
                soldiers who play special flutes in rituals to send off the dead, functioning as a short funeral. The game features six main characters, including two protagonists: 
                Noah, a Kevesi off-seer accompanied by his childhood friends Lanz and Eunie; and Mio, an Agnian off-seer accompanied by fellow servicemen Taion and Sena.</p>

            <P>The music of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has gained lots of attention since the game was announced. With a team helmed by legendary JRPG composer 
                <i>Yasunori Mitsuda</i> (of <i>Chrono Trigger</i>, <i>Xenogears</i>, and <i>Chrono Cross</i> fame), and made up of Xenoblade series veterans ACE, Kenji Hiramatsu, 
                and Manami Kiyota, the music is undoubtably of great quality. One of the most striking tunes heard is the game's main theme — A Life Sent On. 
                Lead by a beautiful Celtic-sounding flute, and evoking powerful emotions, it's a haunting melody, and despite sounding a little Celtic,
                 there's something very unique about it, which comes down to some custom-made flutes.</P>
            <p>These two flutes are based on the flutes that Noah and Mio play in-game. Not only is the flute a key instrument for the game's music, but it's also an important narrative 
                device. Played by an Off-Seer, this person uses the flute to send off the dead with a beautiful, ethereal song. So there was no other way about it — that main theme, the 
                one that plays when Noah is first seen playing the flute in the trailer, had to be played with the same instrument by the musicians. </p>

                <blockquote>
                <p><i>"Before Mitsuda-san started writing the music, he said, "Let's make flutes." I wondered why we should be making them, but Mitsuda-san said, "By making the flutes from scratch,
                    you can create a sound that hasn't been heard before." Since we had told Mitsuda-san in advance that Takahashi-san wanted to interweave the two melodies of Noah and Mio into a
                    single piece of music, Mitsuda-san seemed to have thought that creating the flutes from scratch would enable him to choose a scale freely and express himself more easily. 
                    Above all, he said to me that the fact that the same flutes used in the game exist in real life would be compelling and unique. It sounded interesting, 
                    so I decided to give it a try."</i></p>
                <p><i>"...the music is comprised of two distinct melodies, one of Noah and one of Mio. Noah’s melody is played by a larger flute with a slightly lower pitch, whereas Mio’s melody 
                        is played by a smaller flute with a slightly higher pitch."</i></p>
